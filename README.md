# Kiota Client Action

This repository is responsible for generating client code for the APIs you are using. It leverages the Kiota tool to create strongly-typed clients that simplify API interactions.

## Features

- **Automated Client Generation**: Automatically generate client code for your APIs using GitHub Actions.
- **Strongly-Typed Clients**: Ensure type safety and reduce runtime errors.
- **Customizable**: Easily customize the generated code to fit your needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with generating your client code, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Your API**: Define the API specifications that you want to generate the client for. place the spec under apis/name.yaml

2. **Run the Generation**: The GitHub Action will automatically generate the client code for you.

## Usage

Once the client code is generated, you can include it in your projects to interact with the APIs seamlessly. Refer to the generated documentation for usage examples and API details.
